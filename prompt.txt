Design a modern, interactive, and visually compelling multi-step survey interface for Skill Route’s profile creation flow. Use a blue-themed gradient background inspired by the uploaded images, ensuring high contrast and accessibility. Integrate the Skill Route logo prominently in the header with subtle hover effects and smooth transitions. Each survey question should appear as a card-style component with soft shadows, rounded corners, and animated entry. When a student answers a question, the next card should slide or fade in, creating a seamless progression. Maintain a clean layout with consistent spacing, readable typography (Poppins or Inter), and responsive design for both desktop and mobile. Include hover states for buttons and options using gradient overlays or subtle elevation. After the final question, display a “Complete Profile” button with a glowing hover effect and a success animation. Ensure the entire experience feels personalized, secure, and engaging, with visual cues that guide the user through each step. Prioritize accessibility, branding consistency, and emotional clarity in every design
